Preamble:

The preamble detector length should be shorter than the sync word (p.42). It should be at least 16 bits (p.43).
The preamble detector length is recommended to be 8 or 16 bits (p.43).
It seems like sending a longer preamble than the detector length is not a problem.

Sync word:

If a sync word is expected by the appropiate setting in SetPacketParam() then the
received sync word has to match up with the one stored in the registers.
It can be 1 to 8 bytes long.

Packet length:

There are two settings - fixed and variable. If fixed is chosen, the packet length
has to be set by the master with SetPacketParam(). If instead variable is chosen,
the packet length will be a byte automatically transmitted between sync word and data (p.44).
